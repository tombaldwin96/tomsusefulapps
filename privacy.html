            <p>
                We employ a data minimization approach, collecting and processing only the information 
                necessary to provide and maintain our applications' functionality. All data processing 
                activities are conducted solely for the purpose of delivering our services to you.

                We adhere strictly to the principle of data minimization and do not collect, process, 
                or retain any personal information beyond what is essential for the provision of our 
                services. Unnecessary data is not stored or maintained in our systems.
            </p>

                We retain personal information only for the duration necessary to provide our services

                retain data that is no longer required for service provision, except where retention 
                is mandated by applicable legal or regulatory requirements.
